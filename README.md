# ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Knowledge Retrieval Chatbot

 **An AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI GPT-3.5 and Pinecone for intelligent knowledge retrieval.**  
This chatbot efficiently handles user queries by orchestrating multiple AI agents, retrieving relevant documents, and generating context-aware responses.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a chatbot that:

- Retrieves relevant documents using **Pinecone vector search**  
- Generates intelligent responses with **OpenAI GPT-3.5**  
- Uses a **multi-agent architecture** to ensure modular and scalable processing  

The system consists of multiple agents:

1. **Query Agent**  - Converts user queries into embeddings and retrieves relevant documents.  
2. **Relevance Agent**  - Filters out unrelated search results.  
3. **Answering Agent**  - Generates intelligent, context-aware responses using OpenAI LLM.  
4. **Obnoxious Agent**  - Ensures safety by moderating inappropriate queries.  
5. **Head Agent**  - Coordinates the workflow between all agents, ensuring efficiency.

## Key Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Handling Irrelevant Questions

- If no relevant documents are found, the bot **politely informs** the user instead of generating misleading responses.

### 2. Filtering Inappropriate Queries

- The chatbot detects **offensive or inappropriate** queries and responds with a predefined safe message.

### 3. Managing General Conversations

- The chatbot handles **general interactions**, such as greetings, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

### 4. Multi-Turn Conversation Handling

- Users can ask follow-up questions, and the chatbot **maintains context** to provide deeper insights.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YujieHan-Rachel/multi-agent-chatbot.git
cd multi-agent-chatbot
```
### 2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up API Keys (Security Best Practice)
Ensure your OpenAI API Key and Pinecone API Key are stored as environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-api-key"
```
(For Windows, use set instead of export.)

## Run the Chatbot
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the chatbot.

## Customization & Enhancements
If you want to modify the chatbot behavior:

Optimize Retrieval: Modify Query_Agent in agents.py for better search results.
Enhance Response Quality: Experiment with prompt engineering in Answering_Agent.
Improve Document Filtering: Adjust ranking logic in Relevance_Agent.
